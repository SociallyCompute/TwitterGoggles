Setting up an EC2 instance for TwitterGoggles by libbyh • May 13, 2013 • Code, Research • 0 Comments
TwitterGoggles requires Python 3.3. I’m new to Python, and 3.3 is (relatively) new to everyone. So, getting help is both necessary and challenging. I want to run TwitterGoggles on Amazon EC2 instances, so I’m setting up an AMI that has all of the requirements:

gcc 4.6.3
git 1.8.1.4
mlocate 0.22.2
MySQL 5.5
Python 3.3
I started with an Amazon Linux AMI and installed the stuff I needed. You can save yourself some trouble by launching an instance with my AMI: ami-e73b558e. (I’ll add a link as soon as Amazon approves it)

Install Dependencies
Update the system
sudo yum update
Install C compiler so we can install Python
sudo yum install gcc
Install software yum can take care of for us
sudo yum groupinstall "Development tools"
sudo yum install -y mysql git mlocate
Update the DB locate uses to find your stuff
sudo updatedb
Install Python 3.3.1
Here’s the best guide: http://www.unixmen.com/howto-install-python-3-x-in-ubuntu-debian-fedora-centos/

Basically you have to

Download the release you want. In my case
wget http://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.3.1/Python-3.3.1.tgz
Extract the compressed files and switch the directory
gunzip Python-3.3.1.tgz
tar xf Python-3.3.1.tar
cd Python-3.3.1
Configure, compile, and install
sudo ./configure --prefix=/opt/python3
sudo make
sudo make install
Add python3 to your path
export PATH=$PATH:/opt/python3/bin
Install easy_install-3.3
I ran into some problems related to a missing “zlib” errors. I reinstalled zlib from source, then reconfigured and reinstalled Python 3.3.1. Once that worked, I was able to install and use easy_install-3.3 for module management.

wget http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/d/distribute/distribute-0.6.39.tar.gz
tar xf distribute-0.6.39.tar.gz
cd distribute-0.6.39
sudo python3 setup.py install
